   abstract = {The aim of remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) is to describe a given remote sensing image (RSI) using coherent sentences. Most existing attention-based methods model the coherence through an LSTM-based decoder, which dynamically infers a word vector from preceding sentences. However, these methods are indirectly guided through the confusion of attentive regions, as (1) the weighted average in the attention mechanism distracts the word vector from capturing pertinent visual regions and (2) there are few constraints or rewards for learning long-range transitions. In this paper, we propose a multi-source interactive stair attention mechanism that separately models the semantics of preceding sentences and visual regions of interest. Specifically, the multi-source interaction takes previous semantic vectors as queries and applies an attention mechanism on regional features to acquire the next word vector, which reduces immediate hesitation by considering linguistics. The stair attention divides the attentive weights into three levels—that is, the core region, the surrounding region, and other regions—and all regions in the search scope are focused on differently. Then, a CIDEr-based reward reinforcement learning is devised, in order to enhance the quality of the generated sentences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks (i.e., the Sydney-Captions, UCM-Captions, and RSICD data sets) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art models, in terms of its coherence, while maintaining high accuracy.},

   abstract = {To develop accurate and efficient machine learning models for land cover classification using satellite imagery. This research investigates the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for accurate and efficient land cover classification using multispectral Landsat satellite imagery. The study explores the performance of three DCNN architectures, AlexNet, DenseNet, and VGG-16, on a comprehensive Landsat dataset, comparing their efficacy against traditional machine learning methods, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. Data preprocessing, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning were implemented to model performance. Our findings demonstrate that DCNN-based models, particularly DenseNet and VGG-16, significantly outperform traditional techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Specifically, DenseNet exhibits the most substantial improvements, surpassing the SVM baseline. These results highlight the potential of deep learning for advancing land cover classification from satellite data, enabling more rapid and precise identification of land use categories, such as woodlands, wetlands, and built-up areas. The study also suggests the feasibility of adaptive learning strategies, potentially incorporating reinforcement learning and geospatial information, to further enhance classification efficiency.},

   abstract = {The C-band GF-3 satellite is the first fully polarimetric synthetic aperture (PolSAR) designed by China, which has multi-polarization image modes and been used in various applications. Land cover classification is an effective approach in PolSAR image interpretation and further application. However, conventional classification methods are mostly pixel-based and are easily affected by inherent speckle noise. In addition, the feature selection of PolSAR image and the amount of training samples are also critical to the performance of classifiers. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a region-based PolSAR image classification method, which uses reinforcement learning method altogether with statistical region merging algorithm to improve the classification performance. The contributions of our method are mainly reflected in three aspects: First, the T3 matrix is considered as the only feature set in our method, including image segmentation and classification. Second, the region is produced via statistical region merging algorithm. Finally, a deep reinforcement learning model is used to obtain PolSAR image classification result. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, two real GF-3 images are performed in the experiments, and the experimental results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional methods (support vector machine, random forest, and convolution neural network) in terms of accuracy and achieves the state-of-art results.},

   abstract = {This paper offers a comprehensive overview of machine learning (ML) methodologies and algorithms, highlighting their practical applications in the critical domain of water resource management. Environmental issues, such as climate change and ecosystem destruction, pose significant threats to humanity and the planet. Addressing these challenges necessitates sustainable resource management and increased efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ML technologies present promising solutions in this regard. By harnessing AI and ML, we can collect and analyze vast amounts of data from diverse sources, such as remote sensing, smart sensors, and social media. This enables real-time monitoring and decision making in water resource management. AI applications, including irrigation optimization, water quality monitoring, flood forecasting, and water demand forecasting, enhance agricultural practices, water distribution models, and decision making in desalination plants. Furthermore, AI facilitates data integration, supports decision-making processes, and enhances overall water management sustainability. However, the wider adoption of AI in water resource management faces challenges, such as data heterogeneity, stakeholder education, and high costs. To provide an overview of ML applications in water resource management, this research focuses on core fundamentals, major applications (prediction, clustering, and reinforcement learning), and ongoing issues to offer new insights. More specifically, after the in-depth illustration of the ML algorithmic taxonomy, we provide a comparative mapping of all ML methodologies to specific water management tasks. At the same time, we include a tabulation of such research works along with some concrete, yet compact, descriptions of their objectives at hand. By leveraging ML tools, we can develop sustainable water resource management plans and address the world’s water supply concerns effectively.},

   abstract = {Deep learning has been widely applied in the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image recognition. However, traditional deep learning approaches often struggle with dynamically incorporating new classification targets, given that acquiring all targets simultaneously is generally unfeasible. While incremental learning methodologies for SAR target classification have made noteworthy strides, they have largely neglected the challenges presented by multi-scenes classification. The problem of confusion between backgrounds results in suboptimal performance when addressing diverse classification scene. To remediate this deficiency, we introduce MSTC-Net, which employs a decoupling strategy to train target classifications from different scenes independently before integrating them into a unified network. This approach effectively segregates target information across varied scenes. The experiments demonstrate that MSTC-Net significantly improves the classification accuracy of SAR target in incremental learning.},

   abstract = {Currently private and government agencies use remote sensing images (RSI) for various applications from military applications to agriculture growth. The images can be multispectral, panchromatic, ultra-spectral, or hyperspectral of terra bytes. RSI classification is considered one important application for remote sensing. Climate change detection especially affects numerous aspects of day-to-day lives, for instance, forestry management, weather forecasting, transportation, agriculture, road condition monitoring, and the detection of the natural atmosphere. Conversely, certain research works had a focus on classification of actual weather phenomenon images, generally depending on visual observations from humans. The conventional artificial visual difference between weather phenomena will take more time and error-prone. This paper develops a new reinforcement learning based climate change analysis on satellite multispectral image processing (RLCCA-SMSIP) technique. In order to properly determine climate change, the RLCCA-SMSIP technique employs residual network (ResNet-101) model for feature extraction. Next, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is utilized for climate classification. Finally, parameter selection of the RLCCA-SMSIP technique involves sine cosine algorithm (SCA) for DRL model. For assuring the enhanced outcomes of the presented RLCCA-SMSIP model, comprehensive comparison results are assessed. The obtained values denote the supremacy of the RLCCA-SMSIP model on climate classification.},
